Only directly construct this if you want to use\n * custom modules. Normally, {@link createClient} should be used\n * as it specifies 'sensible' defaults for these modules.\n * @constructor\n * @extends {external:EventEmitter}\n * @extends {module:base-apis~MatrixBaseApis}\n *\n * @param {Object} opts The configuration options for this client.\n * @param {string} opts.baseUrl Required. The base URL to the client-server\n * HTTP API.\n * @param {string} opts.idBaseUrl Optional. The base identity server URL for\n * identity server requests.\n * @param {Function} opts.request Required. The function to invoke for HTTP\n * requests. The value of this property is typically <code>require(\"request\")\n * </code> as it returns a function which meets the required interface. See\n * {@link requestFunction} for more information.\n *\n * @param {string} opts.accessToken The access_token for this user.\n *\n * @param {string} opts.userId The user ID for this user.\n *\n * @param {Object} opts.deviceToImport Device data exported with\n *     \"exportDevice\" method that must be imported to recreate this device.\n *     Should only be useful for devices with end-to-end crypto enabled.\n *     If provided, opts.deviceId and opts.userId should **NOT** be provided\n *     (they are present in the exported data).\n *\n * @param {string} opts.pickleKey Key used to pickle olm objects or other\n *     sensitive data.\n *\n * @param {IdentityServerProvider} [opts.identityServer]\n * Optional. A provider object with one function `getAccessToken`, which is a\n * callback that returns a Promise<String> of an identity access token to supply\n * with identity requests. If the object is unset, no access token will be\n * supplied.\n * See also https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10615 which seeks to\n * replace the previous approach of manual access tokens params with this\n * callback throughout the SDK.\n *\n * @param {Object=} opts.store\n *    The data store used for sync data from the homeserver. If not specified,\n *    this client will not store any HTTP responses. The `createClient` helper\n *    will create a default store if needed.\n *\n * @param {module:store/session/webstorage~WebStorageSessionStore} opts.sessionStore\n *    A store to be used for end-to-end crypto session data. Most data has been\n *    migrated out of here to `cryptoStore` instead. If not specified,\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled. The `createClient` helper\n *    _will not_ create this store at the moment.\n *\n * @param {module:crypto.store.base~CryptoStore} opts.cryptoStore\n *    A store to be used for end-to-end crypto session data. If not specified,\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled. The `createClient` helper will create\n *    a default store if needed.\n *\n * @param {string=} opts.deviceId A unique identifier for this device; used for\n *    tracking things like crypto keys and access tokens.  If not specified,\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled.\n *\n * @param {Object} opts.scheduler Optional. The scheduler to use. If not\n * specified, this client will not retry requests on failure. This client\n * will supply its own processing function to\n * {@link module:scheduler~MatrixScheduler#setProcessFunction}.\n *\n * @param {Object} opts.queryParams Optional. Extra query parameters to append\n * to all requests with this client. Useful for application services which require\n * <code>?user_id=</code>.\n *\n * @param {Number=} opts.localTimeoutMs Optional. The default maximum amount of\n * time to wait before timing out HTTP requests. If not specified, there is no timeout.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.useAuthorizationHeader = false] Set to true to use\n * Authorization header instead of query param to send the access token to the server.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.timelineSupport = false] Set to true to enable\n * improved timeline support ({@link\n * module:client~MatrixClient#getEventTimeline getEventTimeline}). It is\n * disabled by default for compatibility with older clients - in particular to\n * maintain support for back-paginating the live timeline after a '/sync'\n * result with a gap.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.unstableClientRelationAggregation = false]\n * Optional. Set to true to enable client-side aggregation of event relations\n * via `EventTimelineSet#getRelationsForEvent`.\n * This feature is currently unstable and the API may change without notice.\n *\n * @param {Array} [opts.verificationMethods] Optional. The verification method\n * that the application can handle.  Each element should be an item from {@link\n * module:crypto~verificationMethods verificationMethods}, or a class that\n * implements the {$link module:crypto/verification/Base verifier interface}.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.forceTURN]\n * Optional. Whether relaying calls through a TURN server should be forced.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.fallbackICEServerAllowed]\n * Optional. Whether to allow a fallback ICE server should be used for negotiating a\n * WebRTC connection if the homeserver doesn't provide any servers. Defaults to false.\n *\n * @param {object} opts.cryptoCallbacks Optional. Callbacks for crypto and cross-signing.\n *     The cross-signing API is currently UNSTABLE and may change without notice.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.getCrossSigningKey]\n * Optional. Function to call when a cross-signing private key is needed.\n * Secure Secret Storage will be used by default if this is unset.\n * Args:\n *    {string} type The type of key needed.  Will be one of \"master\",\n *      \"self_signing\", or \"user_signing\"\n *    {Uint8Array} publicKey The public key matching the expected private key.\n *        This can be passed to checkPrivateKey() along with the private key\n *        in order to check that a given private key matches what is being\n *        requested.\n *   Should return a promise that resolves with the private key as a\n *   UInt8Array or rejects with an error.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.saveCrossSigningKeys]\n * Optional. Called when new private keys for cross-signing need to be saved.\n * Secure Secret Storage will be used by default if this is unset.\n * Args:\n *   {object} keys the private keys to save. Map of key name to private key\n *       as a UInt8Array. The getPrivateKey callback above will be called\n *       with the corresponding key name when the keys are required again.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.shouldUpgradeDeviceVerifications]\n * Optional. Called when there are device-to-device verifications that can be\n * upgraded into cross-signing verifications.\n * Args:\n *   {object} users The users whose device verifications can be\n *     upgraded to cross-signing verifications.  This will be a map of user IDs\n *     to objects with the properties `devices` (array of the user's devices\n *     that verified their cross-signing key), and `crossSigningInfo` (the\n *     user's cross-signing information)\n * Should return a promise which resolves with an array of the user IDs who\n * should be cross-signed.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.getSecretStorageKey]\n * Optional. Function called when an encryption key for secret storage\n *     is required. One or more keys will be described in the keys object.\n *     The callback function should return a promise with an array of:\n *     [<key name>, <UInt8Array private key>] or null if it cannot provide\n *     any of the keys.\n * Args:\n *   {object} keys Information about the keys:\n *       {\n *           keys: {\n *               <key name>: {\n *                   pubkey: {UInt8Array}\n *               }, ...\n *           }\n *       }\n *   {string} name the name of the value we want to read out of SSSS, for UI purposes.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.onSecretRequested]\n * Optional. Function called when a request for a secret is received from another\n * device.\n * Args:\n *   {string} name The name of the secret being requested.\n *   {string} user_id (string) The user ID of the client requesting\n *   {string} device_id The device ID of the client requesting the secret.\n *   {string} request_id The ID of the request. Used to match a\n *     corresponding `crypto.secrets.request_cancelled`. The request ID will be\n *     unique per sender, device pair.\n *   {DeviceTrustLevel} device_trust: The trust status of the device requesting\n *     the secret as returned by {@link module:client~MatrixClient#checkDeviceTrust}.\n */\n\n\nfunction MatrixClient(opts) {\n  opts.baseUrl = utils.ensureNoTrailingSlash(opts.baseUrl);\n  opts.idBaseUrl = utils.ensureNoTrailingSlash(opts.idBaseUrl);\n\n  _baseApis.MatrixBaseApis.call(this, opts);\n\n  this.olmVersion = null; // Populated after initCrypto is done\n\n  this.reEmitter = new _ReEmitter.ReEmitter(this);\n  this.store = opts.store || new _stub.StubStore();\n  this.deviceId = opts.deviceId || null;\n  const userId = opts.userId || null;\n  this.credentials = {\n    userId: userId\n  };\n\n  if (opts.deviceToImport) {\n    if (this.deviceId) {\n      _logger.logger.warn('not importing device because' + ' device ID is provided to constructor' + ' independently of exported data');\n    } else if (this.credentials.userId) {\n      _logger.logger.warn('not importing device because' + ' user ID is provided to constructor' + ' independently of exported data');\n    } else if (!opts.deviceToImport.deviceId) {\n      _logger.logger.warn('not importing device because no device ID in exported data');\n    } else {\n      this.deviceId = opts.deviceToImport.deviceId;\n      this.credentials.userId = opts.deviceToImport.userId; // will be used during async initialization of the crypto\n\n      this._exportedOlmDeviceToImport = opts.deviceToImport.olmDevice;\n    }\n  } else if (opts.pickleKey) {\n    this.pickleKey = opts.pickleKey;\n  }\n\n  this.scheduler = opts.scheduler;\n\n  if (this.scheduler) {\n    const self = this;\n    this.scheduler.setProcessFunction(async function (eventToSend) {\n      const room = self.getRoom(eventToSend.getRoomId());\n\n      if (eventToSend.status !== _event.EventStatus.SENDING) {\n        _updatePendingEventStatus(room, eventToSend, _event.EventStatus.SENDING);\n      }\n\n      const res = await _sendEventHttpRequest(self, eventToSend);\n\n      if (room) {\n        // ensure we update pending event before the next scheduler run so that any listeners to event id\n        // updates on the synchronous event emitter get a chance to run first.\n        room.updatePendingEvent(eventToSend, _event.EventStatus.SENT, res.event_id);\n      }\n\n      return res;\n    });\n  }\n\n  this.clientRunning = false;\n  this.callList = {// callId: MatrixCall\n  }; // try constructing a MatrixCall to see if we are running in an environment\n  // which has WebRTC.
