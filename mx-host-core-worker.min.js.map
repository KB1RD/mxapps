The base identity server URL for\n * identity server requests.\n * @param {Function} opts.request Required. The function to invoke for HTTP\n * requests. The value of this property is typically <code>require(\"request\")\n * </code> as it returns a function which meets the required interface.

A provider object with one function `getAccessToken`, which is a\n * callback that returns a Promise<String> of an identity access token to supply\n * with identity requests. If the object is unset, no access token will be\n * supplied.\n * See also https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10615 which seeks to\n * replace the previous approach of manual access tokens params with this\n * callback throughout the SDK.\n *\n * @param {Object=} opts.store\n *    The data store used for sync data from the homeserver.

This client\n * will supply its own processing function to\n * {@link module:scheduler~MatrixScheduler#setProcessFunction}.\n *\n * @param {Object} opts.queryParams Optional. Extra query parameters to append\n * to all requests with this client. Useful for application services which require\n * <code>?user_id=</code>.\n *\n * @param {Number=} opts.localTimeoutMs Optional. The default maximum amount of\n * time to wait before timing out HTTP requests. If not specified, there is no timeout.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.useAuthorizationHeader = false] Set to true to use\n * Authorization header instead of query param to send the access token to the server.\n *\n * @param {boolean} [opts.timelineSupport = false] Set to true to enable\n * improved timeline support ({@link\n * module:client~MatrixClient#getEventTimeline getEventTimeline}).

Will be one of \"master\",\n *      \"self_signing\", or \"user_signing\"\n *    {Uint8Array} publicKey The public key matching the expected private key.\n *        This can be passed to checkPrivateKey() along with the private key\n *        in order to check that a given private key matches what is being\n *        requested.\n *   Should return a promise that resolves with the private key as a\n *   UInt8Array or rejects with an error.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.saveCrossSigningKeys]\n * Optional. Called when new private keys for cross-signing need to be saved.\n * Secure Secret Storage will be used by default if this is unset.\n * Args:\n *   {object} keys the private keys to save.

This will be a map of user IDs\n *     to objects with the properties `devices` (array of the user's devices\n *     that verified their cross-signing key), and `crossSigningInfo` (the\n *     user's cross-signing information)\n * Should return a promise which resolves with an array of the user IDs who\n * should be cross-signed.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.getSecretStorageKey]\n * Optional. Function called when an encryption key for secret storage\n *     is required. One or more keys will be described in the keys object.\n *     The callback function should return a promise with an array of:\n *     [<key name>, <UInt8Array private key>] or null if it cannot provide\n *     any of the keys.\n * Args:\n *   {object} keys Information about the keys:\n *       {\n *           keys: {\n *               <key name>: {\n *                   pubkey: {UInt8Array}\n *               }, ...\n *           }\n *       }\n *   {string} name the name of the value we want to read out of SSSS, for UI purposes.\n *\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.onSecretRequested]\n * Optional.

Used to match a\n *     corresponding `crypto.secrets.request_cancelled`.
